Make periodogram of sales

Investigate response of sales to oil prices
--Check lag response

Check response to holidays and events
--lag/lead response

transactions.csv just counts the total number of transactions per day

check proportions of family (automotive, baby care, etc.)
--Check periodicity of each of these
--response to oil and holidays
--average these predictions and compare to the calculated response fo all sales. If it matches well, it should be a good method
