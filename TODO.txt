TODO            |
=================
- Truncate some of the coefficients on storage. No reason to take a lot of space on data that will never be used
- See if I can simplify the way that the data gets stored to feather
- Add function to detrend and retrend the data using linear model before calculating fourier

Added function lm_predict()
- need to clean it up
- need to add feature for saving to disk
